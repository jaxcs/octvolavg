OCT Volume Averager (Version 1.3.6)

The OCT Volume Averager plugin registers and averages optical coherence
tomography (OCT) volume datasets that are acquired by repeated scanning
from a single eye to improve the detection of fine detail. The plugin relies
on the TurboReg and StackReg plugins to perform image registration. OCT
Volume Averager is most useful for efficient processing of input data that
are organized to include repeated scans from one or more eyes in a single
folder. However, it also accepts data opened in ImageJ/Fiji. Currently the
plugin has been tested on OCT volumes acquired with a Bioptigen Envisu R2200
UHR-SDOIS instrument and includes the Bioptigen OCT Reader plugin for ImageJ
to convert Bioptigen *.oct files to *.tif format. OCT Volume Averager may be
applied in principle to repeated OCT volume scans obtained in *.tif format
from other instruments.

The TurboReg and StackReg plugins were developed by P. Th√©venaz and
coworkers.  See the following websites for more information:
